## üî• Feature Update
* üöÄ The preview version of [constraint feature](./README.md#early-access-to-new-constraint-feature) is released to branch [`constraint_esm`](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix/tree/constraint_esm).
* ü™ê The [training data pipeline](./docs/prepare_training_data.md) is released.
* ‚ö°Ô∏è  The [MSA pipeline](./docs/msa_pipeline.md) is released.
* üõ∏ Use [local colabfold_search](./docs/colabfold_compatiable_msa.md) to generate protenix-compatible MSA.

## Installation

### Run with PyPI (recommended):

```bash
pip3 install protenix
```

## Inference

### Command line inference

If you set up `Protenix` by `pip`, you can run the following command to do model inference:

```bash
# the default n_cycle/n_step/n_samples is 10/200/5 respectively, you can modify it by passing --cycle x1 --step x2 --sample x3

# run with example.json, which contains precomputed msa dir.
protenix predict --input examples/example.json --out_dir  ./output --seeds 101

# run with multiple json files, the default seed is 101.
protenix predict --input ./jsons_dir/ --out_dir  ./output

# if the json do not contain precomputed msa dir,
# add --use_msa_server to search msa and then predict.
# if mutiple seeds are provided, split them by comma.
protenix predict --input examples/example_without_msa.json --out_dir ./output --seeds 101,102 --use_msa_server
```

### Convert PDB/CIF file to json

If your input is pdb or cif file, you can convert it to json file for inference.

```bash
# ensure `release_data/ccd_cache/components.cif` or run:
python scripts/gen_ccd_cache.py -c release_data/ccd_cache/ -n [num_cpu]

# for PDB
# download pdb file
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/7pzb.pdb
# run with pdb/cif file, and convert it to json file for inference.
protenix tojson --input examples/7pzb.pdb --out_dir ./output

# for CIF (same process)
# download cif file
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/7pzb.cif
# run with pdb/cif file, and convert it to json file for inference.
protenix tojson --input examples/7pzb.cif --out_dir ./output
```

### Performance details

**Detailed information on the format of the input JSON file and the output files can be found in [<u> input and output documentation </u>](docs/infer_json_format.md)**.

Alternatively you can run inference by:

Note: by default, we do not use layernorm and EvoformerAttention kernels for simple configuration, if you want to speed up inference, see [<u> setting up kernels documentation </u>](docs/kernels.md).

```bash
bash inference_demo.sh
```

Arguments in this scripts are explained as follows:

* `input_json_path`: path to a JSON file that fully describes the input.
* `dump_dir`: path to a directory where the results of the inference will be saved.
* `dtype`: data type used in inference. Valid options include `"bf16"` and `"fp32"`.
* `use_msa`: whether to use the MSA feature, the default is true.
* `use_esm`: whether to use the ESM feature, the default is false.


### Convert PDB/CIF file to json

If your input is pdb or cif file, you can convert it to json file for inference.
```bash
# run with pdb/cif file, and convert it to json file for inference.
protenix tojson --input examples/7pzb.pdb --out_dir ./output
```

### MSA search
We also provide an independent MSA search function, you can do msa search from json file or fasta file.
```bash
# run msa search with json file, it will write precomputed msa dir info to a new json file.
protenix msa --input examples/example_without_msa.json --out_dir ./output

# run msa search with fasta file which only contains protein.
protenix msa --input examples/prot.fasta --out_dir ./output
```

## Training
If you're interested in model training, see [<u> training documentation </u>](docs/training.md).

## Performance
#### **Model Performance across Several Benchmarks**

#### ***Early Access to NEW Constraint Feature!***

üéâ Protenix now allows users to specify ***contacts***, enabling the model to leverage additional inter-chain information as constraint guidance! We benchmarked our constraint feature on Posebuster and a protein-antibody interfaces subset. Protenix demonstrates powerful ability in predicting more accurate structures. If you want to have a try, checkout to branch `constraint_esm` for details about the input format.

![Constraint Metrics](assets/constraint_metrics.png)

> **Tips:** Our online service already supports the new features, so feel free to try it now! Due to the preview version, the constraint support is only applicable in the branch `constraint_esm`. If you want to run inference via the command line, please check out to this branch first.

## Training and Inference Cost

See the [<u>model_train_inference_cost documentation</u>](docs/model_train_inference_cost.md) for memory and time consumption in training and inference.
